## Problem 3. Test Client
Create a test client that tests your BankAccount class.</br>
Support the following commands:</br>
•	Create {Id}</br>
•	Deposit {Id} {amount}</br>
•	Withdraw {Id} {amount}</br>
•	Print {Id}</br>
•	End</br>
If you try to create an account with an existing Id, print "Account already exists".</br>
If you try to perform an operation on a non-existing account, print "Account does not exist".</br>
If you try to withdraw an amount larger than the balance, print "Insufficient balance".</br>
The Print command should print "Account ID{id}, balance {balance}". Round the balance to the second digit after the decimal separator.</br>
